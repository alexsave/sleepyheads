# This "input" configures a global authorization rule to enable public access to

#input AMPLIFY { globalAuthRule: AuthRule = { allow: public } } # FOR TESTING ONLY!


# This is where it really gets fun. Let's think of the things we need to load
# Query
# Sleeps By Timeline, like a feed
# Sleeps By user, on a profile
# Sleeps By Group, for the group page
# Some kind of sleep ranking by group (most sleep this week, earliest riser, latest riser, least sleep)
# User info like image, name, bio
# Maybe an image with the post
# Search for users and groups

# Mutators
# Change user info
# Join group
# Leave group
# Upload images and stuff
# Upload sleep (custom and most important labmda for sure)
# Upsleep sleep
# Downsleep a sleep
# Comment a sleep
# (sharing will be handled entirely in app)

# it's a lot, but get these checked and we can honestly submit the app at that point
