This is the Sleepyheads app.

A thing to note is that react-native-health didn't have all the functionality I needed it to have when I started working on this.
As such, I have manually added changes from https://github.com/agencyenterprise/react-native-health/pull/218/ and https://github.com/agencyenterprise/react-native-health/pull/247/ and https://github.com/agencyenterprise/react-native-health/pull/228/.
Might as well fork at this point.
